Password generator

I created a mini project called "Password Generator" using React. It leverages the useState, useCallback, and useEffect hooks, along with Tailwind CSS for styling. This project generates passwords with lengths ranging from a minimum of 6 characters to a maximum of 100 characters. Users can easily adjust the password length using a range slider and can include numbers and special characters by selecting checkboxes. After generating the desired password, users can click the copy button to copy the password to their clipboard.
